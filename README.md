# Dependency-Track Maven Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iabudiab/dependency-track-maven-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iabudiab/dependency-track-maven-plugin)


[Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org) is an intelligent Software Supply Chain Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk from the use of third-party and open source components.

This plugin is modelled after the [Dependency-Track Jenkins Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/dependency-track-plugin) in order to be used in non-Jenkins environments.

Minimum supported Dependency Track version: `3.6.0`

- [Configuration](#configuration)

# Quick Overview

This plugin can interact with Dependency-Track to perform several security-related actions, e.g. upload/download [CycloneDX SBOMs](https://cyclonedx.org/)
 to/from Dependency-Track, check project metrics, compute diffs etc.

A `Security Gate` can also be configured, in order to fail the build, when a preconfigured number of findings are reported by Dependency-Track.

This plugin also supports custom `suppressions` not configured in Dependency-Track, that filter out specific findings before applying the
security gate.

# Usage

To use the plugin add it into the `build` section of your `pom.xml`. The minimal viable configuration looks as follows:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>dev.iabudiab</groupId>
    <artifactId>dependency-track-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <dependencyTrackUrl>https://dependency-track-installation</dependencyTrackUrl>
        <dependencyTrackApiKey>${env.DTRACK_API_KEY}</dependencyTrackApiKey>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

## Configuration

These parameters are required to configure the plugin:

- `dependencyTrackUrl`: The URL where Dependency-Track is hosted.
- `dependencyTrackApiKey`: The API Key for Dependency-Track.

Further you skip the plugin execution with the following configuration:

- `skip`: a boolean value indicating if the plugin should be executed for the current project.

The API Key should have sufficient permissions depending on the performed action:

| Permission                | Description                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BOM_UPLOAD`              | Allows the uploading of CycloneDX and SPDX BOMs            |
| `PROJECT_CREATION_UPLOAD` | Allows the dynamic creation of projects                    |
| `VIEW_VULNERABILITY`      | Allows access to view vulnerabilities                      |
| `VIEW_PORTFOLIO`          | Allows access to view the components portfolio             |


## Suppressions

In order to suppress findings a `JSON` file containing suppression definitions can be configured as follows:

| Parameter     | Description                   | Default Value                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `suppression` | Path to the suppressions file | `${project.basedir}/suppressions.json` |


```json
{
  "suppressions": [
     {
       "by": "purl",
       "purl": "pkg:maven/org.springframework/spring-web@5.3.10?type=jar"
     }
  ]
}
```

Currently, the plugin supports these kinds of suppressions:

- **By PURL**: Suppresses all findings for a given component identified by its `purl`

```json
{
  "by": "purl",
  "purl": "pkg:maven/org.springframework/spring-web@5.3.10?type=jar",
  "regex": false,
  "expiration": "2022-12-23",
  "notes": "Some notes explaining why this was suppressed",
  "state": "NOT_AFFECTED",
  "justification": "REQUIRES_CONFIGURATION",
  "response": "WILL_NOT_FIX"
}
```

- **By CVE**: Suppresses a finding identified by its Vulnerability ID `CVE`

```json
{
  "by": "cve",
  "cve": "CVE-2021-22096",
  "expiration": "2022-12-23",
  "notes": "Some notes explaining why this was suppressed",
  "state": "FALSE_POSITIVE",
  "justification": "NOT_SET",
  "response": "WORKAROUND_AVAILABLE"
}
```

- **By CVE of PURL**: Suppresses a finding identified by its Vulnerability ID `CVE` affecting a specific component identified by its `purl`

```json
{
  "by": "cve-of-purl",
  "cve": "CVE-2021-22096",
  "purl": ".*org.springframework\/spring-web.*",
  "regex": true,
  "expiration": "2022-12-23",
  "notes": "Some notes explaining why this was suppressed",
  "state": "RESOLVED",
  "justification": "NOT_SET",
  "response": "NOT_SET"
}
```

### upload-scan

Uploads a Dependency-Check XML Report to Dependency-Track. A project is created in Dependency-Track if it doesn't already exist.

Configuration:

| Parameter                 | Description                                                | Default Value                               |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `projectName`             | The unique name of the porject in Dependency-Track         | `${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}`  |
| `projectVersion`          | The version of the project in Dependency-Track             | `${project.version}`                        |
| `artifactDir`             | The directory of the artifact to upload                    | `${project.build.directory}`                |
| `artifactName`            | The name of the artifact to upload                         | `dependency-check-report.xml`               |

---

### upload-bom

Uploads a CycloneDX or SPDX BOM to Dependency-Track. A project is created in Dependency-Track if it doesn't already exist.

Upon uploading a BOM to Dependency-Track a token is returned, which can be checked for processing status if `pollToken` is `true`.

If `pollToken` is set to `false`, then this goal would upload the BOM, write the token to a file at `tokenFile` and then exit.

Once the token is processed, the findings are available and can be fetched for further analysis.

This goal polls Dependency-Track for `tokenPollingDuration`, which defaults to `60` seconds, then prints a findings report. The findings can be matched against a `security gate` in order to fail the build, which can be configured as follows:


```xml
<plugin>
    ...
    <configuration>
        <securityGate>
            <critical>1</critical>
            <high>2</high>
            <medium>3</medium>
            <low>4</low>
        </securityGate>
    </configuration>
    ...
</plugin>
```

- If a matching suppression found for a finding returned from server and `uploadMatchingSuppressions` is set to `true`, it will be suppressed in Dependency-Track server too by using the provided information.
- If a matching suppression found for a finding returned from server and `resetExpiredSuppressions` is set to `true`, then the corresponding Analysis is reset in Dependency-Track server, when the local suppression expires.

### check-token

Polls a token for processing status and applies a `SecurityGate` on the fetched findings.

The token value can be either read from a file via the `tokenFile` or passed directly as `tokenValue` property.

If both are set then `tokenValue` takes precedence over `tokenFile`.

Configuration:

| Parameter                 | Description                                                | Default Value                                                                   |

---

### check-metrics

Checks a project's current metrics and applies a `SecurityGate` on any current findings.

Configuration:

| Parameter                 | Description                                                | Default Value                                                                   |

---

### diff

Computes a diff between two local BOM files and outputs the results.

The resulting diff indicates for each component whether it is `added`, `removed` or stays `unchanged` if the `first` BOM is applied to the `second`.

This goal mimics the behaviour of the same command in [cyclonedx-cli](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli).

- The **JSON** output format produces the same results as the `cyclonedx-cli`, which can be written to a destination file.
- The **TEXT** output format produces the same textual output in stdout as  `cyclonedx-cli`.

Configuration:

| Parameter      | Description                                                         | Default Value                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `from`         | The path of the first BOM for comparison                            |                                         |
| `to`           | The path of the second BOM for comparison                           |                                         |
| `outputFormat` | The format of the result output. Can be either **JSON** or **TEXT** | JSON                                    |
| `outputPath`   | The path of the output file                                         | `${project.build.directory}/diff.json`  |

---

### diff-dependency-track

Computes a diff between a local BOM file and its counterpart of the corresponding project in Dependency-Track. This can be used,
for example, to check if the local state differs from the last imported BOM in Dependency-Track and act accordingly.


If the project doesn't yet exist in Dependency-Track, then the local BOM is compared with a dummy empty BOM, which would result
in a diff indicating that all the components in the local BOM would be `added` if applied.

Configuration:

| Parameter       | Description                                                         | Default Value                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `localBomPath`  | The path of the local BOM                                           | `${project.build.directory}/bom.xml`    |
| `outputFormat`  | The format of the result output. Can be either **JSON** or **TEXT** | JSON                                    |
| `outputPath`    | The path of the output file                                         | `${project.build.directory}/diff.json`  |
